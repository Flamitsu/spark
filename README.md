## Description
**Spark** is a **boot manager** written in Rust that aims for **speed** and **stability** during the **boot** process.
## Features
- Minimalist
- Fast
- Stable
- Maintainable and modular
## TODO
### TODO (general binary):
- [X] ESP automatic detection

- [X] Installation process and removal

- [X] Establishing an ESP directory map

- [ ] Modifying the NVRAM variables successfully

- [ ] Generating operating system entries

- [ ] Supporting custom signatures of the binary
### TODO (UEFI binary):
- [X] Detect user input

- [ ] Booting any kernel an initramfs

- [ ] Supporting firmware signatures

- [ ] Choose between entries

- [ ] Parsing the system's entries in the ESP

- [ ] Customization of the general config file
## Requirements
- UEFI firmware
- Rustup configured
- x86_64 architecture
- QEMU installed and configured with a Linux OS instance
- QEMU virtual snapshot of the virtual machine before executing the software
- FAT32 file system mounted in either `/boot`,`/boot/efi` or `/efi`
## Installation
Make sure you have the [rustup](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) toolchain before trying to build the binary.

Clone the repository and compile: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flamitsu/spark
cd spark
cargo build-uefi # This command builds the binary for the .efi bin.
cargo build-normal # This command builds the general binary.
```
However, `cargo build-uefi` may produce an error. If that happens, it may be that you don't have the toolchain installed. 
To proceed execute: `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-uefi` and re-run: `cargo build-uefi` command.
## Execution
### Disclaimer
> This code is still work in progress and it is not meant to be executed in the host machine in any way. You should have a QEMU snapshot (or the software you are using to virtualize an environment) and then execute the software.

To execute the binary, it is **extremely recommended** to be inside a **virtual machine**.

After the installation process is complete, you need to run the following command: `./execute.sh`, reboot the virtual machine and it should boot the EFI binary.
